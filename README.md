## My personal Blog : https://gabrieldasneves.github.io/

This project is about the usage of **Jekyll** with **Github Pages**.

## Motivation

I apreciate to write about the things I find interesting and important but, not everything should be written in a network geared towards the professional area, right?

I went after platforms like Medium and I felt that something was bothering me.

"I know how to code, so I could make a blog by myself, I don't need to rely on a platform and I can even choose the style I want!"

Soon, I went after options to develop the Blog and discovered Jekyll. A Ruby on Rails-based tool for developing static websites.

There is still a lot to learn in this tool.

## Requirements

To run it with a code editor (E.G.: VS-code), you should have:


  - Ruby version 2.5.0 or above, including all development headers (ruby version can be checked by running ruby -v)
  - RubyGems (which you can check by running gem -v)
  - GCC and Make (in case your system doesn’t have them installed, which you can check by running gcc -v,g++ -v and make -v in your system’s command line interface)


## Installing

Before we install Jekyll, we need to make sure we have all the required dependencies.

<b>sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev</b>

<b>echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc</b>

then finally install it:

<b>gem install jekyll bundler</b>

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Credits
Give proper credits. This could be a link to any repo which inspired you to build this project, any blogposts or links to people who contrbuted in this project.
